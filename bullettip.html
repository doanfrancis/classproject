            There are differences is the exterior of the projectles as well as the shapes. For this article I will just be talking about the different shapes 
            the bullet tips can have. There are three main types: round nose, flat point, hollow point. Round nose have a rounded tip and flat point is just flat.
            Round nose and flat point pretty much serve the same purpose which is target practice. The difference is that while a firearm may operate better with 
            round nose, it will not create as clean a hole as flat point on paper. Hollow point bullets looks like a flat point but someone took a drill to the tip.
            the purpose of the hollow point is that it will expand on impact create massive damage. It is used for self-defense and good for mitigating overpenetration.

            <dd>- Designed to expand upon impact causing major damage to the target. Mitigates overpenetration, good for lowering collateral damage.</dd>
