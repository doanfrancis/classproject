            There is a lot more to gun powder than just a grainy powder that burns. The actual powder itself can take on different shapes depending on which company
            produced it. It could look like little rods or flakes or tiny pellets but that does not matter much in terms of how it performs in a firearm. What matters
            is the burn rate of the powder. For the best performance, you want the powder to reach peak burn near the end of the barrel. This is a balancing act between
            barrel length and powder burn rate. Generally, you'd want a faster burning powder in shorter barrels and slower burning powder in longer barrels. If the 
            barrel is too short, there won't be enough time for the powder to burn and if it is too long, the projectile could actually slow down a bit while in the barrel.
            Both scenarios results in a slower velocity.
