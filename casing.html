        <h1>Casings</h1>
    </header>
    <article class="info">
        <p>
            Other than the obvious different sizes the casings can have, I want to explain the possible materials the casings can be made from. Let's start
            with the most common material which is brass. One of the most popular reasons for why brass is used is because it is a tough material that can withstand
            the high pressures of the gases releasing from the ignited gun powder AND it is corrosion resistant which makes it good for long-term storage. 
            You can also reuse the brass case because of its ductile nature, meaning able to be deformed without cracking. The second material that casings 
            could be made out of is steel. Steel cased ammo is associated as being cheap and budget friendly. However, it is also known to jam up some weapons
            because while the case mouth does expand while being fired, which is what we want to create a seal for the gases, it does not contract well. The third
            material is aluminum. These exist for the same reasons as steel cased ammo. They are cheaper to produce, but an advantage this has over the steel is 
            that the material is lighter.
